mmcs - my media categories suite... something that was never finished...
---

This ended up as a lot of Win32 API / windowing code which I didn't like working on and then left this to rot one day...

Some of the windowing code might be worth salvaging. Something like Qt or Electron would be worth using more instead of fucking around with Win32 APIs and windows...
